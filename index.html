									<h2><a href="#">About Me<br /></a></h2>
									<p> I'm a third-year Computer Science student at York University, originally from Dubai, UAE and now living in Toronto. My passion lies in data visualization, data analysis and web development and I'm always on the lookout for new ways to interpret complex data sets. Recently, I've become interested in the exciting and rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity and plan to start my journey in this field soon. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the city, trying new foods, and learning about different cultures.Let's have a look at some of the projects I have created using various tools and languages.</p>
